    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In DSP, quantization is part of life. It happens at the interface between the analog and the digital world (usually following sampling), and is an operation by which an analog physical quantity at the input, which we could imagine to be of infinite precision, gets converted to a number represented by a finite number of (binary) digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analog-to-digital conversion is not the only conversion where quantization happens. One is often forced to perform quantization in the digital domain where the intermediate representation is of higher resolution than the resolution used at the system output. This particular type of quantization between different digital representations is called *requantization*. For instance, in audio it is not uncommon to make high-resolution acquisition with A/D converters of more than 16 bits (up to 24), keep a $24$-bit representation for the sake of processing, but then having to produce audio streams in 16-bit PCM used by CD's.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the signal being quantized is confined to a certain range. Let's say the interval $[s_{\\it min},s_{\\it max}]$ is the smallest such interval, and it is divided up in $N$ subintervals. A quantizer maps the value of its input to the index (a value between $0$ and $N-1$) of the subinterval that contains the input value. Instead of the index, the quantizer is usually considered to output a concrete value, and that value is the center of the input value-enclosing interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, $N$ is oftentimes a power of 2 ($N=2^b$), and the minimum number of bits $b$ needed to represent $N$ is used to characterize the quantizer as being $b$-bit."

    "The most common quantizer type is what's known as the *uniform quantizer*, whose quantization subintervals are of equal size $\\Delta$ (commonly called *quantization step size*) and the output values are equally spaced. The step size is also referred to as 1 LSB, as the change of one least significant bit in the quantization output index (a number between $0$ and $N-1$) corresponds to a change of output equal to $\\Delta$.\n",

    "Quantization is a lossy operation. Namely, as whole intervals get mapped onto a single value, there is no way to recover the exact value of the input by seeing the output (mathematicians would say that the quantization function is not injective, so it doesn't have an inverse).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Quantization error* $e$ is the difference between the signal at the quantizer's input and its output, $e = y - x$. Since the output of quantization corresponds to the center of the interval containing the input value, conventional quantization theory models the error $e$ at any time instant as a *uniformly distributed random variable* in the interval $[-\\Delta/2,\\Delta/2)$. Furthermore, according to this model, quantization error $e$ viewed as a time-domain signal is a *white noise process* with zero mean and power $\\Delta^2/12$ (which follows from the properties of the uniform distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a uniform quantizer is expressed in reference to a peak-to-peak sinusoidal signal as the input. If the quantizer has $N=2^b$ levels in the range $[s_{\\it min},s_{\\it max}]$ and the sinusoid has the amplitude $(s_{\\it max}-s_{\\it min})/2$, the SNR is given by\n",
    "\n",

Furthermore, one should now see the rationale behind the often-used claim that a 16-bit representation gives an SNR of 96 dB and that the dynamic range of 16-bit PCM audio (used by audio CD's) is 96 dB.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model of the quantization error mentioned above is valid only for a family of input signals with very particular statistical properties; it is therefore not of universal relevance. The formula for SNR is also of limited accuracy, as the SNR tends to decrease as quantization gets coarser. When the quantizer is of high resolution however, this model is fairly accurate and illustrative."

    "If we think again of the mapping performed by a quantizer, we can see that there is nothing stochastic about it. Namely, given any input signal, we can easily compute the quantizer's output and the quantization error, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that the error is unlikely to look like noise, especially if the input signal is simple and well structured, as is the case for sinusoidal signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This easily becomes apparent as one decreases the quantizer's resolution (or decreases the input signal's power while keeping the resolution constant). If we keep things simple and quantize a sinusoidal signal with a coarse uniform quantizer, we can easily notice a patterned shape of the quantization error. Furthermore, the spectrum of the quantized signal in this case contains not only one line at the sinusoid's frequency, but several spectral lines with amplitudes high above what appears to be the noise floor. Also, upon listening, one gets convinced that the quantization error in this particular case is best described as *distortion*, rather than noise, and appears much more detrimental to the signal than would be the noise of equal power."

    "## Dithered quantization\n",
    "\n",
    "Having quantization error appear as noise is more desirable than it taking the form of signal-dependent distortion. The addition of noise (analog noise in A/D conversion and digital noise in requantization) prior to quantization is a way to turn quantization distortion into noise at the price of a small decrease in SNR. This noise signal that gets added to the input signal prior to quantization is referred to as *dither*.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of dithered quantizers:\n",

    "\n",
    "Subtractively dithered quantizers add dither $\\nu$ prior to quantization, but then the same dither $\\nu$ gets subtracted at the receiver end. One can't fail to notice the practical difficulty of having such systems, as the receiver needs to be in sync with the sender in order to be able to reproduce the same dither. But irrespective of this difficulty, the subtractive dither can serve as an example of what dithered quantization can achieve and give the upper bound to the more practical, non-subtractively dithered quantizers that we'll cover in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important result that holds for subtractively dithered quantizers states that one can design dither signals which *for any input signal* turn the quantization error \n",
    "$$e=Q(x+\\nu) - \\nu - x$$ \n",
    "into *white noise independent from the input*. For instance, an iid dither whose samples are uniformly distributed (dither with rectangular pdf that we'll denote as RPDF) inside the interval $[-\\Delta/2,\\Delta/2)$ guarantees that. With such dither, quantization error's power equals $\\Delta^2/12$, which is precisely what happens in the idealized, conventional (or high-resolution) quantization model mentioned previously."

    "1. If dither $\\nu$ has uniform pdf in $[-\\Delta/2,\\Delta/2)$, the error $e$ is zero-mean irrespective of the input; however, its power is not independent of the input and this phenomenon is often called *noise modulation*\n",
    "2. More importantly, dither with triangular pdf (TPDF) in $[-\\Delta,\\Delta)$ solves the noise modulation issue of the uniform pdf and makes the noise's second moment (i.e. its power) independent from the input and equal to $\\Delta^2/4$. The error signal $e$ is not iid (and cannot be made iid in any non-subtractive quantization system), but its spectrum is white.\n",

As we have pointed out in the short overview of the method, with a careful choice of the used dither $\\nu$, for instance an iid dither with uniform pdf in $[-\\Delta/2,\\Delta/2]$, one makes the quantization noise that is *white and independent from the input*, with the same power as the error of the high-resolution quantizer.\n",

    "We mentioned the difference between the RPDF and TPDF dither. Both help linearize the quantizer's characteristic and make the quantization error noise-like. However, with the RPDF dither, the error's second moment (or variance/power) is not independent on the input signal, and that artifact is known as *noise modulation* or *modulation noise error*. With the TPDF dither, this artifact is absent. However, it comes at a price -- the quantization error with the TPDF dither is by 4.77 dB larger than the undithered $\\Delta^2/12$ baseline error power (compared to 3.01 dB increase for the RPDF dither).\n",

    "### Some observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the spectra of the signals and the quantization error in the case of no dithering vs. dithering with the two types of dither, we can state the following:\n",
    "1. Without dither, we clearly see that the quantized signal's nature has been quite astonishingly changed when the quantization becomes coarse; not only is the spectral line at the signal's frequency present, but we also see additional spectral lines and some of them with power close to the power of the signal itself. If we listen to the quantized signal, it appears harmonic, but notably different than the original\n",
    "2. Dithered signals are apparently more noisy, which we can see from their spectra and the spectra of the quantization errors. In both dithered signals, we hear the original sinusoidal sound, while the white noise contamination is quite audible.\n",
    "\n",
    "It shouldn't come as a surprise that the quantized signals with dither are more noisy, i.e. the error between the original and the quantized signal has larger power than the error of the quantized signal with no dither added. After all, the dither itself is nothing but added noise and it would be very suspicious if it decreased the power of the quantization error.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, we have seen that correlated quantization error, as was the case with quantization without dither, tends to change the nature of the signal from the quantizer's input. In case of a sinusoidal input, it could be seen as added harmonic distortion, and its effect is perceptually unpleasing. The purpose of the added dither is to whiten the quantization error and decorrelate it from the input signal. So it can be seen as an intentional increase of the quantization error for the sake of making the output more perceptually pleasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question that still remains to be answered is whether something can be done about the noise, i.e. if it can be rendered less audible."

    "## Noise shaping\n",
    "\n",
    "Dithered quantizers are able to make the quantization error behave similarly to white noise, thereby removing the distortion characteristic of quantization without dither. The natural progression from just adding dither and making the quantization error noise-like is to find ways to process it such that the effect of quantization is mitigated even further, at least perceptually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise shaping can be done in many ways, but the principal idea is to feed back the quantization error through a filter and subtract it from the input signal, as illustrated in the figure below.\n",

    "y = x + e * (1-h),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where filter $h$ is a causal filter with $h_0=0$, namely filter $h$ has to have a delay of at least one sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen that if TPDF dither is used, the quantization error resembles white noise. Thus, the spectral shape of the quantization error is determined by $|1-H(e^{j\\omega})|^2$, so the crux of the noise shaping filter design is coming up with $1-H(e^{j\\omega})$ such that the resulting quantization noise is least audible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The noise shaping idea is closely knit with the knowledge that our auditory system is not equally sensitive at all frequencies. Namely, it has been known for a long time and quantified through psychoacoustic experiments in the first half of the 20-th century that a signal of a given power can appear differently loud if its frequency changes. Munson and Fletcher's experiments have traced the famous [equal loudness contours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour), and that was probably among the first systematic attempts to quantify our loudness perception.\n",

    "Equal loudness contours can be interpreted as our auditory system's sensitivity at different frequencies (or the inverse thereof, to be more precise). Hence to reduce the loudness of the quantization noise, one can design the filter $1-h$ to reflect the sensitivity to low-level noise, which is commonly done by approximating an equal loudness contour at a low loudness level (e.g. 15 phons)."

    "### Noise shaping key practical facts\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that the quantizer uses the TPDF dither, which - as we mentioned - makes the quantization error's mean and variance independent from the input signal; moreover, it makes the spectrum of the quantization error white. Furthermore, with the TPDF dither, quantization error's power equals $\\Delta^2/4$ without noise shaping.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectrum of the quantization error with the noise shaping filter is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(e^{j\\omega}) = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{4} |1-H(e^{j\\omega})|^2 . $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to reduce the audibility of the quantization noise, the filter $H(e^{j\\omega})$ is computed such that the weighted noise power of the form \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} P(e^{j\\omega})\\, W(e^{j\\omega})\\, \\mathrm{d}\\omega $$\n",
    "\n",
    "is minimized. $W(e^{j\\omega})$ is a non-negative function of frequency that models human auditory system's sensitivity at low noise levels and is usually derived from the $15$-phon equal loudness contour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we list some key results from the theory of noise shaping filter design:\n",
    "1. For a noise shaping filter of the form $1-H(e^{j\\omega})$, where $H(e^{j\\omega})$ has no constant terms, we have $$ \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\log\\left|1-H(e^{j\\omega})\\right|^2 \\mathrm{d}\\omega \\geq 0; $$ the equality holds when $1-H(e^{j\\omega})$ is [minimum-phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_phase).\n",
    "2. The optimum noise shaping filter $1-H(e^{j\\omega})$ that minimizes the weighted power $$ \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} P(e^{j\\omega})\\, W(e^{j\\omega})\\, \\mathrm{d}\\omega $$ is such that it satisfies $$ |1-H(e^{j\\omega})|^2 = \\frac{w}{W(e^{j\\omega})} $$ and is minimum-phase, where $w$ is a constant. Given the result in point (1) above, it is easy to obtain the value of the constant $w$, which is given by $$ w = \\exp\\left({\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} W(e^{j\\omega}) \\mathrm{d}\\omega}\\right). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing condition in (1) knowing (2), we can see that for the optimal noise shaping filter, the areas under and above the unit gain (or 0 dB) must be *equal on the logarithmic scale*. This means that attenuating the quantization noise at some frequencies will inevitably amplify it at others. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, since the equality of areas under and above the unit gain is equal on the logarithmic scale, the area above the unit gain will always be bigger on the linear scale (this can be proved using [Jensen's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_inequality), but one can infer it intuitively by comparing values like 0.5 and 2, 0.1 and 10 etc.). Thus, the *total quantization noise power with a noise shaping filter will always increase compared to no noise shaping*. This phenomenon of increasing the noise power to make it less audible may appear awkward and unintuitive, but one should be convinced by hearing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should also mention that with dithering, and especially with dithering and noise shaping, there is a total noise power gain that needs to be taken into account when designing a quantizer or requantizer. Namely, as the combination of dither and shaped quantization noise are combined with the signal, there is an inevitable increase in the range of values at the quantizer's input beyond the original $[s_{\\it min}, s_{\\it max}]$. The quantizer or requantizer thus needs extra levels (or adjustments of values $s_{\\it min}$ and $s_{\\it max}$) to accommodate this and avoid overloads. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, to avoid instabilities due to possible overflows or underflows when the quantizer overloads or underloads, the quantizers should have a saturated input-output characteristic. This means that values above $s_{\\it max}$ should be quantized as $s_{\\it max}$, while values below $s_{\\it min}$ as $s_{\\it min}$."

    "## A different perspective on the Tsividis paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me try to explain the paradox to begin with: listening to a CD with Ravel's Bolero (known for its use of a long crescendo), Tsividis noticed atrocious distortions when a flute plays - quietly of course - at the very beginning of the piece. Given those, he posed a question on the kind of interplay between analog, digital, and the quantization process itself that could explain the unrecognizable all-but-pleasant sound of the flute.\n",
    "\n",
    "My explanation is very simple, which doesn't mean it's correct (Occam's razor can be only a razor, after all). I claim the annoying distortion could be attributed to the inadequacy of (re)quantization, probably due to the lack of appropriate dithering and/or noise shaping used for mastering the CD. This notebook was also an attempt to explain my hypothesis.\n"

    "It will turn out that the observed range, at least when the power is averaged over half-second intervals, is around 60 decibels. Of course, to capture variations on a shorter scale without distortions on either end (quiet and loud), one expects some safety margin to be added on both."
